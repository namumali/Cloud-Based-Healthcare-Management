A Case Study on Enhancing Security through AWS Architecture

This paper presents a case study examining the potential of deploying a digital healthcare management website utilizing cloud-based architecture to enhance security and operational efficiency considering recent data breaches affecting the U.S. healthcare sector. The U.S. Department of Health has highlighted a significant data breach impacting the sensitive information of approximately 800,000 individuals in a recent case of OnePoint Patient Care data breach incident, which occurred on a network server that lacked the robust security measures available in cloud environments. Given that healthcare is a highly human-centric field, it requires significant human intervention for daily tasks, including patient management, staff scheduling, and safeguarding confidential patient records. By transitioning to a cloud-based infrastructure, healthcare institutions can secure sensitive data, enhance scalability, and improve overall operational efficiency. A well-designed cloud architecture offers a solid foundation that inherently mitigates risks associated with data breaches. This approach not only safeguards patient information but also fosters transparency and effective communication between patients and healthcare providers. Moreover, utilizing a dedicated cloud environment presents a more reliable solution compared to traditional third-party hosting options, where data integrity is often compromised. The proposed cloud architecture not only addresses the immediate concerns of data security but also lays the groundwork for future innovations in healthcare management, including potential integrations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, leading to improved patient outcomes and advancements in healthcare delivery.
